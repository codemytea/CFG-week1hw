            <h2>My interests, hobbies and various other paraphinalia</h2>
            <p>As an established bibliophile, I own a rather large collection of books. And a rather large collection
                of wool - you can often find me in a corner reading and crocheting, or reading and cross-<br>stitching, or reading and
                macaraming, you get the idea. I also enjoy coding, and sometimes undertake hacakathons if I'm up to a day or 
                two's worth of undue stress. I also used to rather love<br> skiing, but my kneecaps have decided that it's not a hobby
                they'd like to participate in - they chronically dislocate. I'm currently in recovery from surgery 
                <a href="https://www.hss.edu/conditions_medial-patellofemoral-ligament-reconstruction-mpfl.asp#:~:text=having%20patellar%20instability.-,What%20is%20MPFL%20reconstruction%3F,experienced%20more%20than%20one%20dislocation." target="_blank"><em>(MPFL reconstruction)</em></a> 
                so fingers<br> crossed I might get to ski once more.
